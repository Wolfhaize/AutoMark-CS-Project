# AutoMark – Smart Grading Assistant

**AutoMark** is a mobile application designed to help **Educators (Teachers and Lecturers)** automatically mark student exam scripts and assign grades with the assistance of **AI and OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and also generate a pdf for the results.

The app simplifies the grading process by offering two main options:

* **Auto-Marking** (Keyword Matching & Logic-based Grading)
* **AI Marking** (Contextual Feedback & Scoring using AI)

AutoMark allows users to scan or upload exam scripts, extract answers, compare them with a preloaded answer key, and generate grades automatically. It also provides options for **manual override**, **result storage**, and **report generation**.


## Mobile App Features

### **Key Screens & Functionalities**
* **HomeScreen** - Central Hub with navigation cards to access certain screens like screens for unmarked scripts
* **Upload Script Screen** - Upload student exam script currently as images(either using a phone camera or directly from the gallery), file uploads planned in future versions.
* **Unmarked Scripts Screen** - View all uploaded scripts awaiting marking. Each script is shown as a card.
* **AnswerKey Screen(Marking-guides)** - Perform actual Marking. Choose between Auto-Marking or AI-Based Marking.
* **Marked Scripts Screen** - View all marked scripts along with feedback(ai), score and also method used for marking
* **Results Screen** - Displays the student names(or numbers) with their scores in percentage form , includes an option to generate a PDF report for subject.
